### Inventory

#### Computers
* [~~2007 MacBook Pro 2,2~~](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-2-duo-2.16-15-specs.html)
  * Sold on 9/2015. Firewire ports starting acting buggy when recording (overheating issue), SSD compatibility was also limited
  * Specs
    * 15.4" Matte Screen
    * 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
    * ATI Radeon X1600 128 MB
* [2012 MacBook Pro 9,1](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.6-15-mid-2012-unibody-usb3-specs.html)
  * This is the main workhorse and road warrior. Only limitation of this guy is the 1 thunderbolt port
  * Specs
    * 15.4" Matte Screen
    * 2.6 GHz Quad Core Intel Core i7
    * NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB - realized from the first MBP that GPU memory is well worth the investment
    * 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM
    * [1TB Samsung 840 EVO SSD](http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/MZ-7TE1T0BW)
    * One Thunderbolt 2 port, 2 USB 3.0 ports

* [2011 iMac 11,2](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac-core-i5-2.7-27-inch-aluminum-mid-2011-thunderbolt-specs.html)
  * This machine is ideal for ProRes multicam editing and AE renders, but is far slower than the 2012 MBP for final H264 renders
  * Specs
    * 27" Screen
    * 2.7 Ghz Quad Core Intel Core i5
    * Two Thunderbolt 2 ports, four USB 2.0 ports
    * AMD Radeon HD 6770M 512 MB

#### Hardware

* [Sony HDR-FX7 HDV 1080i camera](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/459129-REG/Sony_HDRFX7_HDR_FX7_3CMOS_HDV_1080i.html)
  * Really great for well lit venues, 20x optical zoom
  * 15' Firewire cable to record to disk rather than MiniDV tapes
  * Still used for livestreaming and/or a zoomed out B cam shot, because the quality loss is less noticeable
  * Reds are a little dark
* [Sony FDR-AX100 4K camera](http://www.sony.com/electronics/handycam-camcorders/fdr-ax100)
  * Large 1" sensor, fantastic quality color with great low light tolerance
  * 12x optical zoom, 18x "Clear Image Zoom" at 4K (but cannot do face detection then)
  * Unable to pipe 4K via HDMI _while_ recording to SD card, so have to switch to HD when doing live stream + recording. Bandwidth issues I assume.
  * In 4K mode the camera doesn't zoom in as far as in 1080 HD mode—it's using the same sensor.
  * No built-in histogram viewer (feed HDMI to your own scopes, see below)
* [~~JuicedLink CX231~~](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/563070-REG/juicedLink_CX231_CX231_Audio_Mixer_and.html)
  * To feed mic/line level XLR inputs into the camera directly as a 3.5" mic stereo input
  * JuicedLink has since gone out of business, [possible reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/6xugk8/juicedlink_is_gone/)
  * After about eigh years this has developed some noise floor problems, looking to replace
* [Blackmagic UltraStudio Mini Recorder Thunderbolt](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/ultrastudiothunderbolt/techspecs/W-DLUS-04)
  * Used as HDMI input for live streams
  * Also used to check cameras for proper exposure, using ScopeBox
  * Thunderbolt endpoint, cannot daisy chain (maybe some technical bandwidth limitation)
* [Blackmagic Intensity Pro Shuttle USB 3.0](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/intensity)
  * Provides additional composite and component input for capturing from older VHS tapes, etc. for archiving footage
  * Can also be used as an additional HDMI input for live streams/scopes
  * Just wish it had a power LED
* [Manfrotto 190XPROB Tripod](https://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-190XPROB-3-Section-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B000N7VPRW)
  * I love how this fits inside one of my old Samsonite carry on suitcases
* [Manfrotto 290 Tripod MT294A3](https://www.manfrotto.us/294-aluminum-3-section-tripod)
  * This newer model is slightly longer/taller than the 190XPROB and doesn't fit inside a carry-on
* [Manfrotto 701HDV Pro Mini Fluid Head](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=productlist.jsp&A=details&Q=&sku=556159&is=REG&fromDisList=y)
  * Smaller, lighter fluid head
  * 8.8 lbs capacity
* [Manfrotto MVH502AH Pro Fluid Head](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/827210-REG/Manfrotto_MVH502AH_75Mm_Flat_Head.html)
  * Heavier fluid head, 15.4 lbs capacity
  * Large plate that prevents camera from tipping when various shoes are attached
* (2) Manfrotto 519LV Telescoping Pan Handle
* (1) Manfrotto 502HLV Pan Bar
* PNY Elite Performance Class 10, 95 MB/s SD Cards: (2) 128 GB, (2) 64 GB (for XAVC-S video)
* Transcend 32 GB SD card (came with Sony AX100 but not fast enough for XAVC-S)
* Samson S-convert -10dBV to +4dBu Converter
  * Perfect for plugging laptop/iPhone sound into a mic send
* (4) Harrison FMOD 12dB Inline RCA Attenuator 900087
  * These RCA attenuators are vital for recording off prosumer -10dB REC/TAPE OUT feeds from a mixer into a portable audio recorder like the Zoom H1. Otherwise, transients in the 0-12dB range on the mixer will not have enough headroom to record
* [X-Rite Color Checker Passport Video](https://www.xrite.com/categories/calibration-profiling/colorchecker-passport-video)
* [X-Rite Color Checker Classic](https://www.xrite.com/categories/calibration-profiling/colorchecker-classic)
  * Comes with a nice large white balance card too
* [VariZoom VZ-Rock](https://www.varizoom.com/product/vzrock/)
  * Absolute must for smooth zooms and pans
  * This connects directly in the Sony FX7 but requires additional adapters for the Sony AX100
